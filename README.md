**Food Distribution Management System for RBC Hackathon**

Connecting restaurants, food banks, and drivers to reduce food waste and help communities.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

Every day, restaurants have leftover food that could help people in need. Our platform automates the entire process:

1. **Restaurants** create alerts for leftover food
2. **Food banks** get notified and can accept within 10 minutes
3. **Drivers** are assigned to pick up and deliver the food
4. **Real-time tracking** ensures efficient delivery

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask + Firebase (Real-time notifications, Auto-escalation)
- **Frontend**: React (Real-time UI updates)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (Real-time sync)
- **Notifications**: WebSocket (Instant alerts)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd backend
